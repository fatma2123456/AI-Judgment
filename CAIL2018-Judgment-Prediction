    <h3>🔍 Dataset Characteristics</h3>
    <p>This dataset contains:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>183 Criminal Law Articles</strong> and <strong>202 Charges</strong>, covering a wide range of legal scenarios for training and testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Imbalanced Categories:</strong> With certain charges being more frequent, it presents an exciting challenge for models to handle rare cases as effectively as the common ones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔗 Interdependencies</h3>
    <p>The beauty of this task lies in the interconnectedness of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Law Articles</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Charges</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Prison Terms</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each piece influences the others, and predicting one requires understanding how they all fit together.</p>

    <p>The <strong>CAIL2018 dataset</strong> is carefully constructed from <strong>5,730,302 criminal documents</strong> pulled from <strong>China Judgment Online</strong>.</p>

    <h3>🏁 Stages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>First Stage:</strong> Initial trials were conducted with a selected set of documents, marking the first steps of our journey.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Stage:</strong> Final testing with new documents to evaluate the robustness and accuracy of models. The true test of their potential!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔍 Approaches to Legal Judgment Prediction</h2>

    <h3>🔷 Approach 1: Deep Learning Text Classification</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> AI directly predicts judgment outcomes from case facts. It’s like giving the model a case and asking for its verdict.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> While effective, these models don’t explain <em>why</em> they made a particular judgment, leaving us with just the final answer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔷 Approach 2: Chain-of-Thought Prompting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> A game-changer. This method breaks down predictions into logical steps, helping AI reason through the case in a more human-like way.</li>
        <li><strong>Output:</strong> Transparent judgments where every prediction is backed by a well-reasoned chain of thought.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔷 Approach 3: Legal Syllogism Prompting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> A powerful structured reasoning method that uses a deductive approach to predict outcomes:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Law:</strong> Identifying relevant legal rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Fact:</strong> Applying the facts of the case.</li>
                <li><strong>Judgment:</strong> Reaching a conclusion based on the above reasoning.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Output:</strong> This method goes beyond simply predicting — it makes the reasoning process transparent and understandable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🚀 SEMDR Model for Legal Judgment Prediction</h2>

    <h3>🌍 Overview</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Semantic-Aware Dual Encoder Model (SEMDR)</strong> goes beyond surface-level predictions by addressing subtle differences between crimes, handling rare cases, and improving the semantic representation of key facts.</p>

    <h3>🔄 Workflow</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clue Extraction:</strong> Key facts like motivation, actions, and harm are extracted from case descriptions. Utilizes <strong>BERT</strong> for sentence representation learning to understand legal language deeply.</li>
        <li><strong>Reasoning Graph Construction:</strong> A graph-based approach links case facts to predicted judgments, looking at both direct and indirect relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Task Learning:</strong> Simultaneously predicts law articles, charges, and prison terms — all at once, creating a holistic judgment prediction model.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🧳 Example Workflow:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Input Case Description:</strong> "Tom stole a necklace using a razor blade, injuring the victim."</li>
        <li><strong>Clue Extraction:</strong> Theft motivation, razor blade use, injury.</li>
        <li><strong>Output Predictions:</strong> Robbery charge, 60 months imprisonment, Law Article 263.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>🏆 Results</h2>

    <h3>🎯 Performance:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SEMDR</strong> outperforms <strong>BERT</strong> with an <strong>87.60%</strong> accuracy for robbery predictions compared to just <strong>30.12%</strong> with BERT. That’s an impressive leap forward!</li>
        <li><strong>Attention Weights:</strong> SEMDR’s attention mechanism focuses on key legal terms like "rob" and "cash," improving its ability to distinguish between similar charges and make accurate predictions.</li>
    </ul>
